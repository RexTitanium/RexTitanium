Hi I am a AI/ML enthusiast, and currently pursuing a Master's in Computer Science from Indiana University Bloomington.
- I am a skilled MERN stack developer with projects like Ignition which is a Learning Management System to allow professors and students to view, create and submit assignments, create and enroll into courses and create and view notifications.
- I also have diverse knowledge and skills in Machine Learning and Deep learning with notable projects like Plant Health Detection System which uses a model trained on plant images to detect whether a particular area of field is healthy or not.
- Having a keen interest in AI, I have also developed a Computer Vision based surveillance system with a violence detection model which uses a MobileNetV2 pre trained model to detect violences in real time and report to the respective authorities.
- I am currently working on developing a basic Large Language Model like llama, gemini or chatGPT, which is trained on a relatively smaller dataset, in order to understand how a Transformer architecture works and how can custom LLMs be created in order to facilitate the newer generation of fields, to reduce human effort.
